          Alona Blue is a 36 foot catamaran and was designed specifically for private charter sailing and built on
          Panglao Island. Stainless steel railings have been built around the entire boat for safety and making it easy
          to move about the deck. Ladders allow easy access to the ocean for swimming and snorkeling.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the stern (the back end) of Alona Blue is our 3m rubber dingy, Alona Blue 2. The dingy is used for
          going ashore to explore the many beaches of this stunning part of the world or to take our guests to special
          snorkel sites.
        </p>

        <p>
          On deck we offer a variety of relaxing areas for sunbathing with a spacious sunroof as well as two comfortable
          trampoline nets.
        </p>

        <p>
          When youâ€™ve had enough sun, cool shady seating is available both on deck and inside the cabin. Feel free to
          snooze in our on-deck hammock or choose one of our breezy sleeping cabins.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main cabin of the yacht is a spacious 10 square meters with 1.8m (6'1") headroom. An 'L' shaped dining
          table provides seating for six people. Our galley is well organised to produce delicious meals and snacks for
          you to enjoy during your sailing adventure. There is a 21" TV for watching videos and a cd/mp3 player with
          lots of different music to choose from.
